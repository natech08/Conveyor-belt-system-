CONVEYOR BELT SYSTEM:
(USING LED's INSTEAD OF ACTUAL MOTORS)


SO HERE WE HAVE CONSIDERED 2 SWITCHES(BUTTONS) WHICH WILL RUN THE 2LED's.

WHEN BUTTON1 IS PRESSED, LED1 WOULD GLOW INDICATING THAT THE MOTOR1 IS ROTATING IN CLOCKWISE DIRECTION.

WHEN BUTTON2 IS PRESSED, LED2 WOULD GLOW INDICATING THAT THE MOTOR2 IS ROTATING IN ANTI-CLOCKWISE DIRECTION.



WHILE THIS SYSTEM RUNS, ONLY ONE LED/MOTOR WILL BE RUNNING.
AS OBVIOUSLY, NO TWO MOTORS ATTACHED TO THE BELT WOULD ROTATE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
